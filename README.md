## Features

### 1. Pure Audio & High-Fidelity Playback
- **100% Client-First Architecture**: Connects directly to YouTube Music's `WEB_REMIX` InnerTube endpoints. No intermediate servers, no API proxy delays, and zero tracking.
- **High-Bitrate Direct Streaming**: Unlocks direct Opus / AAC streams up to 256kbps for crisp acoustic clarity.
- **Background Playback & Lockscreen Notification**: Full Android MediaSession integration with playback state, scrub controls, artwork display, and seamless headset buttons.
- **Intelligent Stream Pre-Fetching & Caching**: Employs an LRU Media3 `SimpleCache` to preload the next track in the queue, ensuring instant zero-latency transitions.
- **Studio Audio Auto-Resolver**: Intelligently identifies tracks with conversational movie skits, intro dialogues, or music video cuts and automatically prioritizes the clean official studio audio recording.

### 2. Dual Signature Now Playing Player Styles
- **Spotify Encore Style**:
  - Full-screen album art with tactile gesture scrubbing.
  - Floating controls with shuffle, loop, and instant queue reordering.
  - Dynamic harmonic glow derived in real-time from album cover artwork.
- **Blur - Liquid Glass Style**:
  - Apple Music-inspired ultra-high blur glass backdrop (`RenderEffect` / `saturate`).
  - Elevated album artwork with frosted interactive control capsule.
  - Non-overlapping bottom section ensuring complete visual ergonomics.

### 3. RichSync Live Synced & Karaoke Lyrics
- **Real-Time Synchronized Lyrics**: Powered by SimpMusic RichSync and LRCLIB with line-by-line automated scrolling.
- **Word-by-Word Apple Music-Style Karaoke**: Glowing active words synced with audio timestamps for sing-along sessions.
- **Dynamic Cover Art Palette Adaptation**: The lyrics background dynamically extracts the dominant hue from the album art and applies intelligent contrast tuning (leaning into deep, rich tones so white text remains 100% legible).
- **Fullscreen Immersive Lyrics**: Expand lyrics to full screen with customized solid background tinted to the track's color profile and matched control bars.
- **Romanization Engine**: Transliterates Japanese (Kanji/Kana), Korean (Hangul), and Chinese (Hanzi) lyrics to Latin alphabet on the fly.
- **Fine-Grained Timing Offset**: Adjust lyrics timing from `-5.0s` to `+5.0s` in 100ms increments to achieve pitch-perfect synchronization.

### 4. 10-Band Graphic Equalizer
- **10-Band Hardware Curve DSP**: Adjustable frequencies (31Hz, 62Hz, 125Hz, 250Hz, 500Hz, 1kHz, 2kHz, 4kHz, 8kHz, 16kHz) with `-12dB` to `+12dB` range.
- **Curated Acoustic Presets**:
  - *Balanced Sound* — Natural and transparent audio profile.
  - *Bass Booster* — Deep, punchy low-end response.
  - *Vocal Booster* — Enhanced speech clarity and crisp mids.
  - *Treble Booster* — Airy and detailed acoustic highs.
  - *Studio Reference* — Flat uncolored reproduction for studio monitors.
  - *Late Night Lounge* — Compressed dynamics for quiet nocturnal listening.

### 5. Intelligent Automation & Safety
- **SponsorBlock Integration**: Automatically skips intros, sponsor endorsements, self-promotions, interaction reminders, and non-music interludes.
- **Return YouTube Dislike**: Displays real-time like/dislike counts and community approval ratings.
- **Sleep Timer**: Configurable countdown (15m, 30m, 45m, 60m, or end-of-track) with smooth audio volume fade-out.

### 6. Ergonomic UI & Navigation
- **Floating Dynamic Capsule Dock**: Smoothly animating capsule menu bar with spring physics that expands active tab text labels and compresses inactive icons.
- **Floating Overlaid Mini-Player**: Detached mini-player hovering above the interface with a proportional circle-fill play button, high-contrast skip icons, and live progress indicator.
- **Dynamic Greeting Header**: Context-aware greeting (`Good morning`, `Good afternoon`, `Good evening`) welcoming you upon launch.
- **Dynamic Query Filter Pills**: Effortlessly filter feeds by `All`, `New Release`, `Trending`, `Top Chart`, and `Podcasts`.
- **Top Artists Carousel & Dedicated Profile Screen**:
  - Live YouTube Music Charts (`FEmusic_charts`) integration.
  - Tapping an artist opens a dedicated profile with a full-bleed widescreen banner, subscriber count aligned bottom-right, and ranked 1–10 popular songs with stream counts.
  - Vertical 3-dot options menu for every song (*Play Next, Add to Queue, Liked Songs, Add to Playlist*).
- **Community Playlists Carousel & Dedicated Playlist Screen**:
  - Live public playlists uploaded by the YouTube Music community (`EgeKAQQoAEABahIQBBAKEAUQDhADEAkQFRAQEBE%3D`).
  - Full playlist view featuring top banner artwork, title & author/views (e.g. `29M views • 100 tracks`), and complete ranked song list with duration and 3-dot bottom sheet actions.

### 7. Direct Client-Side Spotify Playlist Importer
- **Zero-Server Playlist Conversion**: Simply paste any public Spotify playlist URL (`https://open.spotify.com/playlist/...`).
- **Parallel Resolution**: The app parses Spotify's embed schema directly on your device, resolves high-res covers, and queries matching YouTube Music streams in parallel without needing a backend server or Spotify API credentials.

### 8. Offline-First Library & Cache
- **1-Tap Offline Downloads**: Cache audio streams, metadata, and lyrics directly to device storage for true airplane-mode playback.
- **Favorites & Custom Playlists**: Organize liked tracks and create local playlists with custom covers and descriptions.
- **Stream Cache Management**: 1-tap cache cleaner in Settings to purge temporary media buffers and keep storage lean.

## Audio & Equalizer Fidelity

AURA Music implements a custom audio pipeline operating directly on top of AndroidX Media3:

[ Audio Source (Opus / AAC 256kbps) ]
                 ↓
     [ Media3 SimpleCache ]
                 ↓
     [ ExoPlayer Audio Engine ]
                 ↓
   [ EqualizerAudioProcessor (10-Band) ]
   ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
   │ 31Hz  62Hz  125Hz 250Hz 500Hz     │
   │ 1kHz  2kHz  4kHz  8kHz  16kHz     │
   └───────────────────────────────────┘
                 ↓
     [ Preamp Dynamic Limiter ]
                 ↓
      [ Android AudioTrack HAL ]
```
